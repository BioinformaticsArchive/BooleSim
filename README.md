Built upon previous work located on Google Code

This software provides a browseable user interface,
which allows the user to load protein interaction networks in various formats,
display them and interactively simulate them.

The biographer network UI is used, as well as the d3 force-based layout algorithm.
Everything is JavaScript based, such that this software should work platform-independent.
HTML5-capable internet browsers are required for proper rendering.

Have fun!
