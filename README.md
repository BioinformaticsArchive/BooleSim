Boolean Network Simulator
==================

This software provides a browseable user interface,
which allows the user to load Boolean networks in various formats,
display them and interactively simulate them.
It's coded in JavaScript, so it should work platform-independent.
A recent version of a HTML5-capable internet browser is required for proper rendering,
Chromium recommended (http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium).
