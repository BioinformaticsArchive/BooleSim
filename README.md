Built upon previous work located at Google Code:
http://biographer.googlecode.com/

This software provides a browseable user interface,
which allows the user to load protein interaction networks in various formats,
display them and interactively simulate them.

* Network visualization: biographer (http://biographer.googlecode.com/)
* Layout: d3 (https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Force-Layout)
* Time series graphs: Rickshaw (http://code.shutterstock.com/rickshaw/)
* SBGN compliance (https://github.com/chemhack/libSBGN.js)

Everything is JavaScript based, such that this software should work platform-independent.
HTML5-capable internet browsers are required for proper rendering.

Have fun!
